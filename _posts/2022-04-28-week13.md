Subnetting!!!

This week we went over subnetting and the different ways to divide a network up and for what reasons. We did an exercise that had us watch videos and how to properly Read CIDR notation and idententify the network attributes of that network.

Then we had a practice exercise to utilize what we just learned.

To be honest this was my least favorite week but the videos and exercise did help to understand the most complicated parts.
