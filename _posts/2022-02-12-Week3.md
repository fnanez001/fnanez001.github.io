Module 2 Intro to LAN

In this module we learned the basics of how LAN's are configured at a basic level. There was also an interactive terminal that showed the different types of LAN configurations and how they work, as well as how they can "break". We also learned how subnetting is generally used. It also took us through DHCP and how, at a basic level how DCHP works and configures a device on the network.
