Cabling Exercise:

This week we worked on the cabling module in the book and we also watched a video for the 66 block or 110 block for patch panels. Then we did a rudimentary lab online to show how cables are configured for straight cables, crossover cables, and rollover cables. There was also a pre and post text on the lab.
