Module 3: DNS in Detail

In this module we learned about how a DNS operates when trying to reach a specific website. Using a local cache, if available, then moving outward from the host computer until a DNS lookup is completed and an IP address is obtained for the requested website. There are different record types for containing different information for these webesites. For example, an MX record has information to resolve address issues for email servers.
