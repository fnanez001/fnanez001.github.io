Wifi Hacking 101

This week we went over wireless networking and then in the TryHackMe we reviewed the basics and then used the aircrack-ng suite to put the WNIC into monitor mode and how someone could use that to hack different wireless set-ups. After we used aircrack and a rockyou list to help find the key for the encrypted file for the assignment.
