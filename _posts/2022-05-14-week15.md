Risk Management!

This week we read the risk management chapter in the book. Then for our labe we installed and used nessus to create custom scans for our network. It was a generic "touch base" module to give us an overview. It would be really cool to use on larger networks that have more activity on them than pinging the IP addresses given for the lab, and surely my own home network. SysAdmnin or Security are not my desired fields but you can defintely appreciate the tools they use, and even the simple tools are often really powerful used the right way.
